    <h2 align="center" style="font-family: 'Monotype Corsiva'">Dog Adoption Will Build Life Lessons for Kids of All Ages</h2>
    <p align="center" style="font-family: 'Monotype Corsiva'">Dog adoption provides a fertile opportunity to teach significant values to children.
        The decision to devote your resources and care to a dog in need sends a very clear message about the identity of a family
        and its underlying values. It is a great time to explore who you are as a family and what you stand for.
        It is through this process that a child learns things like, "We are a family with an important choice to make,
        and we are going to use the power of this choice to save a life." This teaches kids about personal responsibility and their
        impact on the greater good as they make choices in life. Children need to feel they can impact their world.
        We need to give them opportunities to do so in positive, pro-social ways.
        Choosing dog adoption can plant the seeds for that ethic.
        Dogs help children get outside more – to go for walks, run, and play – and enjoy all the associated health benefits.
        Kids also learn responsibility by feeding and caring for a dog's routine needs.
        Children with dogs display improved impulse control, social skills and self-esteem.
        And for emerging readers, reading to a dog is an easy way to feel comfortable.</p>
