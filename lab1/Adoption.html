    <h1 align="center " style="font-family: 'Monotype Corsiva'">The Myths of Dog Adoption</h1>
    <p align="center" style="font-family: 'Monotype Corsiva'">Did you know that most dogs do not have a home due to no fault of their own?
        It is a common myth to think that all dogs up for adoption in shelters and rescues are damaged in some way.
        But, nothing could be less true! Dog shelters and rescues are full of lovable,
        active and healthy adoptable dogs just waiting for someone to take them home.
        A majority of dogs are given up when their prior owner can no longer afford the financial requirements to keep them,
        got divorced, had a death in the family or other unexpected change in their family situation,
        or didn't realize how much time & attention a dog adoption deserves and needs.
        Even worse, the number of dog adoptions in need are compounded by a surplus of dogs bred for profit:
        approximately 4 million adoptable pets are killed each year due to overpopulation.
        By taking home a dog adoption from a rescue or a shelter, not only are you saving that pet,
        you're either making room in the rescue so they can save another pet from a shelter,
        or making room at the shelter itself. As you can see, dog adoption is truly a continuous cycle of saving lives,
        and it's the humane thing to do! Thank you for considering dog adoption, and please help us debunk the myth of homeless pets in the future.</p>
